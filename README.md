# Letterboxd Data Analysis Project

[![Tableau Dashboard](graphs/dashboard.png)](https://public.tableau.com/views/LetterboxdAll-TimeStats/Summary?:language=en-US&:sid=C55FD46B312B4FE987D51125B1B0F45A-0:0&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

## Project Objectives | Business Questions

- What are some trends in my movie-watching habits?
    - Specifically rewatch patterns, genres, cast & crew, and release/watch dates.
- Have I been generally watching movies that I end up rating highly?
- Based on highly-rated attributes, what movies should I watch next?

## Summary of Insights

<details>
<summary>Low-level findings</summary>

### Targeted Genre Exploration:

- **Discovery:** While Drama, Comedy, Action, Science Fiction, Adventure, Romance, Thriller, and Crime dominate my viewing habits, I've developed a higher appreciation for less-watched genres like Music, War, History, and Mystery.
- **Action:** Intentionally seek out and watch more films from these underrepresented genres to diversify my cinematic experience and potentially discover new favorites.

### Director and Actor Emphasis:

- **Discovery:** Quentin Tarantino, and Denis Villeneuve are the most watched directors. Samuel L. Jackson, Brad Pitt, J.K. Simmons, Chris Pratt, Scarlett Johansson, and Willem Dafoe are the most watched actors.
- **Action:** Explore more films by directors with a distinct style, especially those I enjoy but haven‚Äôt watched much. Also, consider watching more films featuring under-appreciated actors who have positively surprised me.

### Support for Local Cinema:

- **Discovery:** There's a predominance of US-origin films in my watch history. Making up 85.58% of the entries, while PH-origin movies are only about 3.68%.
- **Action:** Actively seek out films produced in the Philippines to balance my viewing habits and support local industry growth.

### Viewing Habits and Trends:

- There was a huge spike in movie-watching during 2023 because of a more conscious effort to watch more films. The most-watched months are January and April. With release dates, it's clear that I watched more movies released in the last two decades.

### Rewatch Strategy:

- My ratings generally increase on rewatch, particularly for films initially rated above 3 stars, while some like ‚ÄúTrain to Busan‚Äù rated lower. This insight is complemented by the finding that movies with initially high ratings are more likely to be rewatched and often maintain or improve in ratings.

### High-Rating Patterns:

- High ratings are often given to genres like Music, War, History, Mystery, Family, and Drama; directors like Christopher Nolan, Richard Linklater, Richard Curtis, Luca Guadagnino, and Denis Villeneuve have at least two watched-moves that were highly rated; actors like Michael Stuhlbarg, Ethan Hawke, Jake Gyllenhaal, Dave Bautista, Linda Cardellini, Kyle Bornheimer, Haruka Abe, Tom Stourton, Julie Delpy, Angela Bassett, and Domhnall Gleeson are highly rated.

## Recommendations and Next Steps

- Continue the momentum of watching more films and make sure to make a conscious decision of it. Also, consider exploring older movies to appreciate the evolution of cinema.

- Implement a strategy to rewatch films I rated lower than 3 stars to see if my perceptions change over time, providing deeper insights into my rating patterns and preferences. Maybe even surfacing new favorites that I initially overlooked.

- Dive into movies with these specific highly-rated attributes to see if my interest aligns with these high ratings. If not, I could normalize my data to provide a deeper understanding of my preferences.

<summary><i>Just for fun, I plugged these highly-rated attributes into ChatGPT and these are 15 movies it told me to watch next.</i></summary>

High ratings are often given to genres like Music, War, History, Mystery, Family, and Drama; directors like Christopher Nolan, Richard Linklater, Richard Curtis, Luca Guadagnino, and Denis Villeneuve have at least two watched-moves that were highly rated; actors like Michael Stuhlbarg, Ethan Hawke, Jake Gyllenhaal, Dave Bautista, Linda Cardellini, Kyle Bornheimer, Haruka Abe, Tom Stourton, Julie Delpy, Angela Bassett, and Domhnall Gleeson are highly rated.

## General Information

To gather and enrich the data, I exported my data from Letterboxd then used Python to request additional data from the TMDb API. The data was then cleaned, processed, and explored in Python (some cleaning were made in Excel as well), before being visualized in Tableau.
